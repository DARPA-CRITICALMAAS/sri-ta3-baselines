1. WoE & IV computations - done
2. Accounting for neighbors and repeats - Vasily (neighbors - done, repeats 12 extra elements)
        2.1. Added it to the Jupyter .ipynb file - done 
        2.2. Recreating test / train deposit splits - see 3.
3. Spatially stratified cross-fold validation - Angel (done, splits don't match what's reported, not sure what they actually did)
4. Handling NaNs - Angel (done)
5. Merge above code to be able to train / test
6. Implement code that selects best threshold with cross validation
7. Implement code that evaluates WOE model on test set
8. Implement success rate AUC functionality / plot
9. Recreate baseline result in paper
10. Extend above to the "updated" WOE
