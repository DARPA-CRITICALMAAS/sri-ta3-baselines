1. WoE & IV computations - done
2. Accounting for neighbors and repeats - Vasily (neighbors - done, repeats 12 extra elements)
3. Spatially stratified cross-fold validation - Angel (done, splits don't match what's reported, not sure what they actually did)
4. Handling NaNs - Angel (done)
5. Merge above code to be able to train / test - (Vasily - merged neighbors function to .ipynb / IV seems to be very close to the ones in the paper)
6. Implement code that selects best threshold with cross validation
7. Implement code that evaluates WOE model on test set
8. Implement success rate AUC functionality / plot
9. Recreate baseline result in paper
10. Extend above to the "updated" WOE
